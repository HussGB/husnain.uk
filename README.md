# About this repository

I have made my website with NextJS React which is open-sourced so that fellow starter developers could get a grip on React. This is my first project where I've actually used my practicing skills of React on and I hope it satisfies the end-viewer.

You could view this production at https://hussgb.dev

# Installation of this project

To install this project, you could click that eye-glaring green "Code" button which will open up a dropdown. Inside that dropdown click "Download ZIP" or anything that indicates
that you are downloading this source-code.

Once installed, you could extract the folder.

Now that the source-code folder has been extracted you could head into hussgb.dev/ and run command prompt or terminal inside the folder. Run the following command `npm i` which will
install the packages from package.json

If you want to run a development version of the source code, you could next run `npm run dev` which is recommended if you are going to be using my source-code for your own website
and you want to modify the code whilst viewing it live at `localhost:3000`.

I highly suggest that once you've done fiddling with my website that you release your own version on vercel (https://vercel.com) which will make deployment really easy since this
website is made with NextJS (built on top of React). And Vercel is the developer of NextJS so what's better than having Vercel hosting your NextJS website?

Anyhow have a happy day even though it's half two in the morning for me.
